# Unknown Story

Unknown Story is a FiveM french home hosted server for the video-game Grand Theft Auto 5.

In this repository you'll find all the scripts that were used to perform the server.
It was running under a Ubuntu Server 19.10.
It can easily be run under Windows too and any other distribution that support the FiveM FXServer.

A major part of the scripts were taken on the FiveM Forum to create the basement of the project.
I want to notice that I rewrote most of them in order to adapt them to ours needs. 
So if you see a script that you already know take that in consideration before integrating it to your project.
